  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This was a final project I did for my Object-Oriented Programming class. The goal was to create a lightweight contact manager application using Java that allowed users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts. The application featured a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing, making it easy for users to navigate and manage their contacts efficiently.

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Apache NetBeans IDE</li>
    <li>Java Programming</li>
    <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This was one of my first projects early in my career</li>
    <li>Basic CRUD application</li>
    <li>Simple and intuitive GUI using Java Swing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    I learned the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, including concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. Additionally, I gained experience in designing and implementing a user-friendly GUI using Java Swing. This project also helped me understand the importance of code organization and modularity in software development.
