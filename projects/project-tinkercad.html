  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    For my capstone assignment in Software Engineering, I had to design a 3D model and utilize a variety of 3D-Printers to produce a physical version of my design. I used TinkerCAD to create the 3D model, which allowed me to experiment with different shapes and structures before finalizing the design for printing.

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>TinkerCAD</li>
    <li>Python</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The snake represents the time spent learning python</li>
    <li>The coffee cup on the table represented learning Java</li>
    <li>The papers were representative of the hours spent studying</li>
    <li>All of this encapsulated in a structure that looked like Lakeland</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    What I learned from this project included gaining hands-on experience with 3D modeling software and understanding the intricacies of 3D printing technology. I faced challenges in ensuring that my design was both functional and aesthetically pleasing, which required multiple iterations and adjustments. This project also enhanced my problem-solving skills as I navigated the technical aspects of 3D printing, such as material selection and printer settings. Overall, it was a valuable experience that combined creativity with technical skills.
